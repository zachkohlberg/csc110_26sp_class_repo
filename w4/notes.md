# Week 4 Notes

## Types

- variables all have types
- types tell us what kind of information a variable can store
- types we care about this week:
  - String: stores text, sequences of characters
  - int: stores an integer (whole number, can be negative)
  - double: stores an approximation of a real number (these are called
    "floating-point numbers")
  - boolean: true/false values
- in math, we have categories like whole number, integer, rational number,
  irrational number, real number
- in programming, we usually just deal with integers and real numbers

## Literal Values

- a literal value is "hard-coded"; the actual value is written directly in the
  code rather than the result of a calculation or user input
- string literals are enclosed in double-quotes: "
  - "abc"
  - "hello world"
- integer literals are just whole numbers, don't include a decimal point
  - 100
  - -11
  - 10_000_000
- double literals are numbers with a decimal point (even if the number itself is
  an integer/whole number) or written in scientific (e) notation
  - 100.0
  - -3.14
  - 1.75E12 (this is 1.75 times 10 to the 12th power, or 1,750,000,000,000)
  - 0.25E-7 (this is 0.000000025, or 0.25 times 10 to the -7th power)

## Operators

- order of operations: PEMDAS, same as in math
  - parenthesis
  - exponents (no exponent operator, so ignore this part)
  - multiplication and division (and modulo)
  - addition and subtraction (and concatenation)
