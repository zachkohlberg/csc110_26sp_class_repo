// this is a comment
// a line starting with "//" is ignored when the program is run/compiled
// comments are effectively just notes in between actual code

// java programs should start with: void main()
void main() {
	// the code goes inside of a "block", denoted by curly braces: {}
	// IO (capital i, capital o) has some input and output functions
	// println (lowercase L, not 1) stands for "print line"
	// printing means displaying text on the terminal
	IO.println("Hello!!!");
